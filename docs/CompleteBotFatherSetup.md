## Creating a New Bot with BotFather

### Step 1: Start a Conversation with BotFather

1. Open Telegram and search for "BotFather" or click this link: [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)
2. Start a chat with BotFather by clicking the "Start" button

### Step 2: Create a New Bot

1. Send the command `/newbot` to BotFather
2. BotFather will ask you to provide a name for your bot
   - This is the display name that appears in contacts and conversations
   - Example: "OPTRIXTRADES Assistant"
3. Next, provide a username for your bot
   - Must end with "bot" (e.g., "optrixtrades_bot")
   - Must be unique across Telegram
   - Only allows letters, numbers, and underscores

### Step 3: Save Your Bot Token

1. After successful creation, BotFather will provide a token (API key)
2. **IMPORTANT**: This token is used to authenticate your bot with the Telegram API
3. Store this token securely - it should be treated like a password
4. Format: `123456789:ABCDefGhIJKlmNoPQRsTUVwxyZ`

## Essential Bot Configuration

### Step 1: Set Bot Profile Picture

1. Send `/setuserpic` to BotFather
2. Select your bot from the list
3. Send the image you want to use as the profile picture
   - Recommended size: 640x640 pixels
   - The image will be cropped to a square

### Step 2: Set Bot Description

1. Send `/setdescription` to BotFather
2. Select your bot from the list
3. Send a description of your bot (up to 512 characters)
   - Example: "OPTRIXTRADES Assistant helps you manage your trading subscriptions, verify your account, and access premium trading signals."
   - This description appears when users first start a conversation with your bot

### Step 3: Set Bot About Info

1. Send `/setabouttext` to BotFather
2. Select your bot from the list
3. Send a short description (up to 120 characters)
   - Example: "Official bot for OPTRIXTRADES subscription management and trading signals."
   - This appears in the bot's profile

### Step 4: Configure Bot Commands

1. Send `/setcommands` to BotFather
2. Select your bot from the list
3. Send a list of commands with descriptions (one command per line)

```
start - Begin interaction with the bot
help - Show available commands and how to use them
verify - Start the account verification process
account - View your account information and subscription status
support - Contact our support team
trading - Access trading signals and information
```

## Advanced Bot Settings

### Step 1: Configure Inline Mode (Optional)

If your bot uses inline queries:

1. Send `/setinline` to BotFather
2. Select your bot from the list
3. Send a placeholder text that will be shown when users select your bot in inline mode
   - Example: "Search for trading signals..."

### Step 2: Configure Inline Feedback (Optional)

If your bot uses inline mode:

1. Send `/setinlinefeedback` to BotFather
2. Select your bot from the list
3. Choose the percentage of inline queries you want to receive feedback on (25%, 50%, 75%, or 100%)

### Step 3: Configure Privacy Mode

1. Send `/setprivacy` to BotFather
2. Select your bot from the list
3. Choose the appropriate privacy mode:
   - **Enabled**: Bot only receives messages that explicitly mention it by username or commands
   - **Disabled**: Bot receives all messages in groups
   - For OPTRIXTRADES, we recommend **Enabled** for better privacy

### Step 4: Set Group Admin Rights (Optional)

If your bot needs to be an admin in groups:

1. Send `/setjoingroups` to BotFather
2. Select your bot from the list
3. Choose whether your bot can be added to groups
   - For OPTRIXTRADES, select **Enabled** if you want to allow the bot in groups

## Connecting Your Bot to Your Application

### Step 1: Choose Connection Method

Decide between two methods to connect your bot to your application:

1. **Polling**: Your application continuously checks for new messages (simpler, good for development)
2. **Webhook**: Telegram sends updates to your server (more efficient, better for production)

### Step 2: Polling Setup (Development)

1. In your application code, use the bot token to initialize the bot with polling

```javascript
// In src/config/bot.js
const TelegramBot = require('node-telegram-bot-api');
const token = process.env.TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN;

const bot = new TelegramBot(token, { polling: true });

module.exports = bot;
```

### Step 3: Webhook Setup (Production)

1. Ensure you have a domain with SSL certificate (HTTPS is required for webhooks)
2. Set up your server to receive webhook requests

```javascript
// In src/config/bot.js
const TelegramBot = require('node-telegram-bot-api');
const token = process.env.TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN;
const webhookUrl = process.env.TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_URL;

const bot = new TelegramBot(token, {
  webHook: {
    port: process.env.PORT || 8443
  }
});

bot.setWebHook(`${webhookUrl}/bot${token}`);

module.exports = bot;
```

3. Register your webhook with Telegram (can be done via API or BotFather)

## Environment Configuration

### Step 1: Set Up Environment Variables

Create or update your `.env` file with the following variables:

```
# Telegram Bot Configuration
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
TELEGRAM_ADMIN_IDS=admin_id_1,admin_id_2
TELEGRAM_CHANNEL_ID=your_channel_id
TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-domain.com

# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=optrixtrades
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your_password

# Redis Configuration
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# AWS S3 Configuration (for file storage)
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=optrixtrades-files

# Server Configuration
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Step 2: Get Admin and Channel IDs

1. **Admin IDs**: These are the Telegram user IDs of administrators
   - Use [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) to get your user ID
   - Add multiple admin IDs separated by commas

2. **Channel ID**: The ID of your Telegram channel
   - Add the bot to your channel as an administrator
   - Forward a message from your channel to [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot)
   - The channel ID will be in the format `-100xxxxxxxxxx`

## Testing Your Bot

### Step 1: Basic Functionality Test

1. Start a conversation with your bot by searching for its username
2. Send the `/start` command
3. Verify that the bot responds with the welcome message
4. Test each command to ensure they work as expected

### Step 2: Test Admin Commands

1. Log in with an admin account (one of the IDs in `TELEGRAM_ADMIN_IDS`)
2. Send the `/admin` command
3. Verify that admin-specific functionality works correctly

### Step 3: Test Channel Integration

1. Ensure the bot is added to your channel as an administrator
2. Test any channel-specific functionality
3. Verify that the bot can post messages to the channel

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Bot Not Responding**
   - Check if your bot token is correct
   - Ensure your application is running
   - Verify that polling is enabled or webhook is set up correctly

2. **Webhook Issues**
   - Confirm your domain has a valid SSL certificate
   - Check server logs for webhook errors
   - Verify that your server is publicly accessible

3. **Command Registration Problems**
   - Ensure commands are properly registered with BotFather
   - Check that command handlers are correctly implemented in your code

4. **Database Connection Errors**
