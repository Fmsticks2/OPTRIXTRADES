## Introduction to BotFather

BotFather is the official bot created by Telegram for creating and managing other bots. It provides a simple interface to create new bots and change their settings.

**Key Features:**
- Create new bots
- Generate and revoke API tokens
- Set bot profile information (name, description, about text, profile picture)
- Configure bot commands
- Set up inline query support
- Manage bot privacy settings

## Creating Your Bot

### Step 1: Start a Conversation with BotFather

1. Open Telegram and search for "@BotFather"
2. Start a chat with BotFather by clicking "Start"

### Step 2: Create a New Bot

1. Send the command `/newbot` to BotFather
2. BotFather will ask for a name for your bot
   - Enter "OPTRIXTRADES Bot" (or your preferred name)
   - This is the display name that appears in contacts and conversations
3. BotFather will then ask for a username for your bot
   - Enter a unique username ending with "bot" (e.g., "optrixtrades_bot")
   - The username must be available and end with "bot"

### Step 3: Receive Your API Token

After successfully creating your bot, BotFather will provide you with an API token. It looks something like:

```
123456789:ABCDefGhIJKlmNoPQRsTUVwxyZ
```

**IMPORTANT:** This token is used to authenticate your bot with the Telegram API. Keep it secure and never share it publicly.

## Essential Bot Configuration

### Step 4: Set Bot Profile Picture

1. Prepare a square image (at least 640x640 pixels) that represents your bot
2. Send the command `/setuserpic` to BotFather
3. Select your bot from the list
4. Upload the image you prepared

### Step 5: Set Bot Description

1. Send the command `/setdescription` to BotFather
2. Select your bot from the list
3. Enter a description (up to 512 characters)

   Example:
   ```
   OPTRIXTRADES Bot helps you manage your trading subscriptions, verify your account, and access trading signals. Get started with /start.
   ```

### Step 6: Set About Information

1. Send the command `/setabouttext` to BotFather
2. Select your bot from the list
3. Enter brief information about your bot (up to 120 characters)

   Example:
   ```
   Official bot for OPTRIXTRADES trading platform. Access signals, verify accounts, and manage subscriptions.
   ```

### Step 7: Configure Bot Commands

1. Send the command `/setcommands` to BotFather
2. Select your bot from the list
3. Enter the list of commands with descriptions (one command per line, format: `command - description`)

   Example:
   ```
   start - Begin interaction with the bot
   help - Show available commands and how to use them
   verify - Start the account verification process
   signals - Get latest trading signals
   account - View your account information
   subscription - Check your subscription status
   support - Contact customer support
   settings - Configure your notification preferences
   ```

## Advanced Bot Configuration

### Step 8: Configure Privacy Settings

By default, bots can't access all messages in groups. You can change this if your bot needs to process all messages:

1. Send the command `/setprivacy` to BotFather
2. Select your bot from the list
3. Choose either:
   - `Enable` (default) - Bot only receives commands and messages that explicitly mention it
   - `Disable` - Bot receives all messages in groups

**Recommendation:** For OPTRIXTRADES, keep privacy mode enabled unless you specifically need to process all messages in groups.

### Step 9: Configure Inline Mode (Optional)

Inline mode allows users to interact with your bot directly from any chat by typing "@yourbotname":

1. Send the command `/setinline` to BotFather
2. Select your bot from the list
3. Enter a placeholder text that will be shown in the input field

   Example:
   ```
   Search for trading signals...
   ```

### Step 10: Set Up Inline Feedback (Optional)

If you enabled inline mode:

1. Send the command `/setinlinefeedback` to BotFather
2. Select your bot from the list
3. Choose how often you want to receive feedback (e.g., 100%)

### Step 11: Configure Group Admin Rights (Optional)

If your bot will be added to channels or groups as an admin:

1. Send the command `/setjoingroups` to BotFather
2. Select your bot from the list
3. Choose whether your bot can be added to groups

## Connecting Your Bot to Your Application

### Step 12: Choose Connection Method

There are two ways to connect your bot to your application:

#### Option A: Polling (Simpler, Good for Development)

With polling, your application regularly checks for new messages:

```javascript
// In your bot.js or index.js file
const TelegramBot = require('node-telegram-bot-api');

// Replace with your token
const token = process.env.TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN;

// Create a bot instance with polling enabled
const bot = new TelegramBot(token, { polling: true });

// Now you can set up event handlers
bot.on('message', (msg) => {
  // Handle incoming messages
});
```

#### Option B: Webhook (More Efficient, Better for Production)

With webhooks, Telegram sends updates to your server:

1. Set up a secure HTTPS endpoint on your server
2. Configure your bot to use webhooks:

```javascript
// In your bot.js or server.js file
const TelegramBot = require('node-telegram-bot-api');
const express = require('express');

const app = express();
const token = process.env.TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN;
const url = process.env.WEBHOOK_URL; // e.g., https://yourdomain.com/bot

// Create bot instance
const bot = new TelegramBot(token);

// Set webhook path
bot.setWebHook(`${url}/bot${token}`);

// Parse JSON requests
app.use(express.json());

// Set the webhook endpoint
app.post(`/bot${token}`, (req, res) => {
  bot.processUpdate(req.body);
  res.sendStatus(200);
});

// Start Express server
app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000, () => {
  console.log('Webhook server started');
});
```

## Environment Variable Setup

### Step 13: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root with the following variables:

```
# Telegram Bot Configuration
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_from_botfather
TELEGRAM_ADMIN_IDS=123456789,987654321
TELEGRAM_CHANNEL_ID=-1001234567890

# Connection Method (choose one)
# For polling:
USE_POLLING=true

# For webhook:
USE_POLLING=false
WEBHOOK_URL=https://yourdomain.com
PORT=3000

# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=optrixtrades
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password

# Redis Configuration
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# AWS S3 Configuration (for file storage)
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=optrixtrades-files

# Other Settings
NODE_ENV=development
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

For production, create a `.env.production` file with appropriate values.

### Step 14: Load Environment Variables in Your Application

Install the dotenv package:

```bash
npm install dotenv
```

Load environment variables at the beginning of your application:

```javascript
// At the top of your index.js or app.js file
require('dotenv').config();
```

## Testing Your Bot

### Step 15: Basic Functionality Test

1. Start your application
2. Open Telegram and search for your bot by username
3. Start a conversation with your bot by clicking "Start" or sending `/start`
4. Verify that your bot responds with the welcome message
5. Test each command to ensure it works as expected

### Step 16: Test Edge Cases

1. **Group Functionality**: Add your bot to a group and test its behavior
2. **Error Handling**: Try invalid commands or inputs to ensure proper error messages
3. **Concurrent Users**: Have multiple users interact with the bot simultaneously
4. **Long Conversations**: Test multi-step processes like verification
5. **Media Handling**: Test sending and receiving photos, documents, etc.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Bot Not Responding

1. **Check Token**: Verify your bot token is correct in your environment variables
2. **Check Connection**: Ensure your application is running and connected to the internet
3. **Polling vs Webhook**: If using webhooks, verify your server is accessible from the internet
4. **Logs**: Check your application logs for errors

#### Commands Not Working

1. **Command Registration**: Verify commands are properly registered with BotFather
2. **Code Implementation**: Ensure your code correctly handles each command
3. **Case Sensitivity**: Check if your command handlers are case-sensitive

#### Webhook Issues

1. **HTTPS Required**: Webhooks require a valid HTTPS certificate
2. **Firewall Settings**: Ensure your server allows incoming connections on the webhook port
3. **Webhook URL**: Verify the webhook URL is correctly set

#### Rate Limiting

If you encounter rate limiting from Telegram:

1. Implement exponential backoff for retries
2. Reduce the frequency of requests
3. Consider using webhooks instead of polling

## Security Best Practices

### Step 17: Secure Your Bot Token

1. **Environment Variables**: Never hardcode your token in source code
2. **Access Control**: Restrict access to your .env files
3. **Token Rotation**: If your token is compromised, generate a new one with BotFather using `/revoke`

### Step 18: Implement User Authentication

1. **Verify Users**: Implement a verification process for sensitive operations
2. **Admin Commands**: Restrict administrative commands to authorized users
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Step 19: Secure Data Handling

1. **Sensitive Data**: Never store sensitive user data in plain text
2. **Data Minimization**: Only collect information you actually need
3. **Secure Storage**: Use encrypted storage for sensitive information

## Maintenance and Updates

### Step 20: Regular Maintenance

1. **Monitor Usage**: Keep track of bot usage and performance
2. **Update Dependencies**: Regularly update your bot's dependencies
3. **Backup Configuration**: Keep backups of your bot configuration

### Step 21: Adding New Features

When adding new commands or features:

1. Update the command list in BotFather using `/setcommands`
2. Implement the new functionality in your code
3. Test thoroughly before deploying to production
4. Notify users about new features

### Step 22: Handling API Changes

Telegram occasionally updates its Bot API. When this happens:

1. Review the changelog for breaking changes
2. Update your bot code accordingly
3. Test all functionality after updates
